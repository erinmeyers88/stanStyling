Most people are unsure of what Title Insurance is, however it is important to have when buying a home or piece of property.  Knowing just a few key facts can save you hundreds of dollars at closing or protect your investment in the property if problems should arise later.

Title Insurance protects you in case there is a Title dispute. Title disputes are arguments over who legally has the right to the land.


Some common Title Insurance disputes come from:

Undisclosed heirs
American Indian tribal rights
Contractor's liens
Tax liens
Property boundaries
When you finance real estate, the mortgage company requires you to pay for Title Insurance for the amount you are borrowing.  Your home, property, any appreciation, or down payment are not protected unless you get an Ownerâ€™s Title Policy also.

Title Insurance is a one time premium insurance. You pay for your Title Insurance at the closing of your new home and you are covered for as long as you own the home and for any claims of future owners against the Title of the property.

An Agent-Owner at AgentOwned Realty can help you get a Re-Issue Title Insurance Credit when closing on your new home which can save you up to 50% of your Title Insurance Premium.
